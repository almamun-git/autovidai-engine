Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, thank you for reporting it responsibly.

Reporting

- Preferred: Email security@almamun-git with a clear subject `Security report: [short title]` and include steps to reproduce, impact, and any PoC code. If you prefer, open an issue in the repository and mark it as private or use the platform's confidential security reporting feature.
- If you do not receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours, follow up or use the public issue tracker with a `security` label (only after responsible disclosure timeline has passed).

PGP

- If you need to send sensitive details, encrypt them using our PGP key (not provided here). If you need the key, ask maintainers via the email above.

Response process

- We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an initial triage timeline.
- For confirmed issues, we will coordinate patching and disclosure timelines and provide updates until fixed.

Disclosure

- We follow coordinated disclosure; please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to respond.
